## 📋 Overview

**What Did They Say?** is a gameplay-focused communication aid for World of Warcraft Classic. Unlike general-purpose translators, this addon is specifically designed to help players coordinate in groups, whisper, and communicate across language barriers during gameplay.

### Key Features

- ✅ **100% Offline** - All translation logic runs locally in-game, no external APIs
- ✅ **Automated Processing** - Automatically translates messages when confidence is sufficient
- ✅ **Intent Detection** - Understands player intent (LFG, invites, ready status, etc.)
- ✅ **Safe & Conservative** - Stays quiet when confidence is low to avoid wrong translations
- ✅ **Performance Optimized** - Translation caching and message throttling prevent lag
- ✅ **Configurable** - Choose which chat channels to translate
- ✅ **Titan Panel Support** - Optional integration with Titan Panel

### Design Philosophy
